# Todo
A showcase of building Todo with React, Flux, Jest, Webpack Material Design, etc

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start a local server:

```
npm start
```

## Developing

Any changes you make to files in the `app/` directory will cause the server to
automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser.

```
npm run watch
```

Also, any changes you make to files in the `app/` directory will trigger unit tests.


## Production

```
npm run build
```

All production code can be found in /public, you may provide a real server at constants.BASE_URL(http://localhost:3000 by default).
